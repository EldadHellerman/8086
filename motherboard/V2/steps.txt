8086 Motherboard bootstrapping steps:

1. Write binary data to memory chip, with a simple program to automaticly write to memory from data input (auto
   increment the address, and generate all necassery control signals), to allow for easier binary programing.

2. write very basic assembler, with pre-programmed instructions, maybe using a dictionary search,
   then translate to binary by hand and upload using step 1.

3. assemble the same program from step 2 using step 2 assembler.

4. write a better assembler than the one from step 2, supporting more commands, using the assembler from step 3.

5. write better and better assemblers, using the assemblers that are already established.
